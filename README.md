 I made this Sales and Customer Dashboard in Tableau to make 2023 business data easy to see and understand.
 Instead of looking at big reports full of numbers, this dashboard gives a clear and simple view of how the business is growing.
 It shows our total sales, profit, customers, and top products — all in one place.

Highlights from 2023:-
 - Total Sales: $733,000 — up 20.4% from last year
 - Total Profit: $93,000 — up 14.2%, and December was the best month
 - Customers: 693 total — an 8.6% increase
 - Sales per Customer: $1,058 — grew by 10.8%
 - Orders & Items: 1,687 orders, 12,500 items sold
 - Top Products: Phones, Chairs, and Binders were the top-selling items

Why I made this:-
 I built this dashboard because I wanted to make sales data simple and useful for everyone.
 Anyone can quickly see what’s working - which products sell best, how much profit made, and how customers are growing.
It helps turn numbers into a clear story about business performance and progress.

Tools & Skills
 - Tool: Tableau
 - Data: Sales, Products and Customer Records
 - Skills: Data cleaning, visual design, and dashboard building

 This project helped me understand how visuals can make complex data easy to read and share.
 It’s great to see how one dashboard can show an entire year’s growth in just a few charts.
